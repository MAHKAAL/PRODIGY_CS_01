# PRODIGY_CS_01
**This is my projects work which has been assigned during my internship period at Prodigy InfoTech.**

This code is been implemented in Pyhthon Programming language.
This Program helped me in understanding the implementation and usecase of Caeser Cipher Algorithm.
By completing this task now I'm able to make a Program which can perform Caeser Cipher - Encryption and Decryption Operations.
